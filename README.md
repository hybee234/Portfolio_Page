# Coding BootCamp Challenge 1 - HTML, CSS Code Refactor

## Description

This project aims to address Challenge 1 of the Coding Bootcamp with Monash. Students are provided with a functioning webpage and are asked to refactor it.
The User Story and Acceptance Critieria are set out as below:

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes

WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order

WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

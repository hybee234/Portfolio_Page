# Huber Heats Portfolio Page

## Description

This website provides the platform for me to showcase the projects that I have worked on.

Please be aware that I am still building my portfolio, so many of the project cards have placeholders in them (and are captioned as appropriate) 

My portfolio was built to meet the below user story and acceptance criteria

### User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:

WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application

WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
